                    Oh, so you're curious about me?

                <p className='about-text-small'>
                    Well, before you scroll down and read the polished, professional summary that condenses my experiences into a tidy 
                    little paragraph designed to make me sound... impressive, I just wanted to chat to you a little bit about who I 
                    really am. 
                </p>
                <p className='about-text-small'>
                    My name is Naomi. At the time of writing this, I'm 22 years old and constantly drifting between confusion, focus, 
                    ambition, impatience, and uncertainty. Some days I feel like I know who I am and then others I don't have a clue.
                </p>
                <p className='about-text-small'>
                    Some things I do know is that I've always been fascinated by people—by humanity and society. How we connect with 
                    ourselves, and with each other. Community has always meant a lot to me, even before I could fully define what it 
                    was or why it mattered so much.
                </p>
                <p className='about-text-small'>
                    On a more personal note, I've always been a talker (shocker), an all-around lover of the arts, and a MASSIVE 
                    overthinker (to say my brain is a maze doesn't quite cover it.)
                </p>
                <p className='about-text-small'>
                    I created Notes & Quotes as both an outlet for myself and a space where others can relate to one another and grow 
                    together. I hope this space resonates with you in some way—and that it inspires, reassures, or teaches you 
                    something new. 
                </p>
                <p className='about-text-small-nospace'>
                    I'm so grateful you're here.

                <p className='about-text-small-nospace'>
                    Even though I may not know you personally, I care about you.
